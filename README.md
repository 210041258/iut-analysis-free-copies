# 📊 Student Performance Analysis

**Training Models • Performance Measurements • Growth Tracking**

---

## 📌 Overview

This project analyzes student academic performance across multiple assessments using **statistical and machine-learning techniques**.  
The goal is to measure:

- 🧠 **Knowledge Improvement:** Course 1 ➝ Course 2  
- 📈 **Midterm Performance Distributions**  
- 🎯 **Growth Delta** with respect to (y+z) components  
- 🔍 **Score Comparisons** across students  

The repository also includes **visualizations** and **processed datasets** for further modeling and evaluation.
